# Builder Skills

Small, composable skills for coding agents.

These skills are for teams that want the agent to stay sharp where judgment
matters: orchestration, review, planning, validation, and clear communication.
They are not a giant process framework. Install the pieces you want, adapt them
to your project, and let the model keep room to think.

## Skills

### [`efficient-fable`](skills/efficient-fable/README.md)

Use Claude Fable as the orchestrator, architect, synthesizer, and final judge
while lighter agents handle token-heavy research, coding, testing, and log
reduction.

Solves for expensive-model waste: Fable should spend tokens on judgment, not on
reading every file, reducing every log, or manually running every browser check.

### [`efficient-frontier`](skills/efficient-frontier/README.md)

Apply the same orchestration pattern to any high-cost frontier model: preserve
the expensive model for planning, tradeoffs, integration, validation strategy,
and final review; use cheaper agents for bounded heavy lifting.

Solves for broad work that can be parallelized without asking the most expensive
model to do every scan and every edit itself.

### [`visual-plan`](skills/visual-plan/README.md)

Publish an Agent-Native Plan before risky or ambiguous implementation work, with
inline diagrams, file maps, API/data blocks, open questions, comments, and
optional UI or prototype review surfaces.

Solves for planning in chat when the work really needs a reviewable artifact the
user can scan, comment on, and approve before code changes start.

### [`visual-recap`](skills/visual-recap/README.md)

Turn a branch, commit, or PR diff into a visual recap plan that explains what
changed at a higher altitude than raw diff review.

Solves for large diffs that hide the important shape of the change: schema/API
contracts, UI states, architecture moves, file footprint, and key review points.

### [`quick-recap`](skills/quick-recap/README.md)

Add a concise final status block convention so every completed response ends
with a clear green, yellow, or red work-state signal.

Solves for ambiguity at the end of agent work: done, pending a specific
non-routine step, or blocked on the user.

## Install

Install the collection:

```sh
agent-native skills add BuilderIO/skills
```

Pick the skills you want, choose Codex, Claude Code, or both, and decide whether
to add managed `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` instruction blocks for always-on
conventions.

Useful one-liners:

```sh
agent-native skills add BuilderIO/skills --skill efficient-fable --update-instructions
agent-native skills add BuilderIO/skills --skill quick-recap --update-instructions
agent-native skills add BuilderIO/skills --skill visual-recap --with-github-action
```

Instruction-only fallback:

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills@latest add BuilderIO/skills
```

The open Vercel skills installer can also copy the skill folders, but it does
not manage `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` blocks or write the Visual Recap workflow:

```sh
npx skills add BuilderIO/skills --skill quick-recap
```

## Sync Agent Native Plan Skills

`visual-plan` and `visual-recap` are copied from Agent Native. From this repo:

```sh
npm run sync:agent-native-plan-skills
```

The sync script defaults to `../agent-native/framework`. Override the source
with a path argument or environment variable:

```sh
AGENT_NATIVE_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/path/to/agent-native/framework npm run sync:agent-native-plan-skills
npm run sync:agent-native-plan-skills -- /path/to/agent-native/framework
```

In the Agent Native repo, a workflow opens or updates a PR here whenever the
canonical visual skill files change on `main`. Human-facing `README.md` files in
the public repo are preserved as documentation overlays during sync.
