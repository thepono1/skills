# Skills for coding agents

Small, composable skills for coding agents.

These skills are for teams that want the agent to stay sharp where judgment
matters: orchestration, review, planning, validation, and clear communication.
They are not a giant process framework. Install the pieces you want, adapt them
to your project, and let the model keep room to think.

### Quick install all skills

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills add
```

See the [full CLI docs below](#install).

## Skills

### [`/efficient-fable`](skills/efficient-fable/README.md)

Use Claude Fable as the orchestrator, architect, synthesizer, and final judge
while lighter agents handle token-heavy research, coding, testing, and log
reduction.

Solves for expensive-model waste: Fable should spend tokens on judgment, not on
reading every file, reducing every log, or manually running every browser check.

### [`/efficient-frontier`](skills/efficient-frontier/README.md)

Apply the same orchestration as `/efficient-fable` to any high-cost frontier
model: preserve the expensive model for planning, tradeoffs, integration,
validation strategy, and final review; use cheaper agents for bounded heavy
lifting.

Solves for broad work that can be parallelized without asking the most expensive
model to do every scan and every edit itself.

### [`/stay-within-limits`](skills/stay-within-limits/README.md)

Check current 5-hour and weekly usage before substantial work and between
parallel waves, then pause new execution at 95% until the active window is clear
enough to continue.

Solves for long-running agent sessions that accidentally exhaust the current
budget window mid-task instead of pausing cleanly and resuming with a
self-contained plan.

### [`/visual-plan`](skills/visual-plan/README.md)

Turn risky plans into human-optimized MDX documents with custom visual blocks:
diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, visual schema maps, OpenAPI-style API specs,
annotated code, open questions, and review comments.

Solves for plans that are too important to bury in chat. The output is
scannable, commentable, and intuitive enough for a human to approve before code
changes start.

### [`/visual-recap`](skills/visual-recap/README.md)

Turn a branch, commit, or PR diff into a human-optimized visual recap with MDX
and custom components: annotated diffs, diagrams, API diffs, visual schema maps,
file maps, and UI state summaries.

Solves for diffs that hide the shape of the change. Reviewers can understand
contracts, architecture moves, schema changes, and UI impact before diving into
raw line-by-line review.

### [`/quick-recap`](skills/quick-recap/README.md)

Add a concise final status block convention so every completed response ends
with a clear green, yellow, or red work-state signal.

Solves for ambiguity at the end of agent work: done, pending a specific
non-routine step, or blocked on the user.

Example green status:

```md
🟢 Updated quick recap docs with output examples
```

Example yellow status:

```md
🟡 Code updated, set PROVIDER_WEBHOOK_SECRET before testing webhooks
```

## Install

Run the installer:

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills add
```

The installer walks you through the choices:

- Which skills to install.
- Codex, Claude Code, or both.
- User-level or project-level install.
- Whether to add managed `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` instruction blocks when the
  selected skills have always-on guidance.
- Whether to add the PR Visual Recap GitHub Action when `/visual-recap` is
  selected.

Skip the picker with `--skill`:

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills add --skill quick-recap
npx @agent-native/skills add --skill visual-recap --with-github-action
```

You can also use Vercel's `skills` CLI for a plain skill-folder copy:

```sh
npx skills add BuilderIO/skills --skill quick-recap
```

That installer is useful for quick copying, but it does not add the managed
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` instruction blocks or the PR Visual Recap GitHub
Action that pair well with these skills.
